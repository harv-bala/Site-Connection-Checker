# Site Connection Checker

Site Connection Checker (SCC) is a command line tool which allows you to continuously check the status of any website(s).

### Why Might I Use Site Connection Checker?

It is not uncommon to visit a website only to find that, for whatever reason, it is out of action. At this point, you can either waste time constantly refreshing the page in the hopes that it will go back online, or you can leave the site for some arbitrary and likely excessive amount of time and hope that when you try again, the site is working.

Neither of these options are particularly ideal, which is why SCC exists. By automatically checking the status of any website(s) you request, at timed intervals you set, SCC can alert you as soon as a website is back online and connection is established.

### Features

- Automatically run status checks on any website(s)
- Customisable status check time intervals
- Create your own list of websites to be checked
- Get alerts when websites on your list go back online
